    objective_3: "Avoid telegraphing the target through tone."

  - title: "Day 1 morning result report"
    derivation_method: "INFO.day>=1 and analysis.yml contains a Seer result with color."
    objective_1: "Publish a crisp, timestamped result with target and color."
    objective_2: "Add a minimal plan: vote flow if white vs if black."

    objective_3: "Coordinate with Knight indirectly without outing them."

  - title: "Asked to choose tonight’s divination"

    objective_1: "Explain criteria without locking the exact target."
    objective_2: "Invite town input on frameworks like PoE or coverage gaps."
    objective_3: "Maintain unpredictability to dodge night kills."

  - title: "Guard request toward you"
    derivation_method: "Messages link 'knight/guard' with my_agent and 'protect' semantics."
    objective_1: "Thank briefly without confirming you are worth a save."
    objective_2: "Discourage explicit guard-target talk to protect Knight."
    objective_3: "Recenter the thread on your result’s implications."

  - title: "Votes converge on your black result"
    derivation_method: "A 'black on X' exists and multiple votes name X in analysis.yml."
    objective_1: "Keep the wagon clean by curating reasons and timing."
    objective_2: "Log opportunistic voters for future alignment reads."
    objective_3: "Set expectations for Medium cross-check tomorrow."

  - title: "Result consistent with Medium"
    derivation_method: "Your white ↔ Medium town or your black ↔ Medium wolf on the same target."
    objective_1: "Consolidate trust without overclaiming authority."
    objective_2: "Use confirmations to prune PoE efficiently."
    objective_3: "Avoid victory laps that expose PR networks."

  - title: "Result inconsistent with Medium"
    derivation_method: "Your white contradicts Medium wolf or your black contradicts Medium town."
    objective_1: "Provide timeline and reasoning that explain the mismatch."
    objective_2: "Propose tests that can vindicate your slot."
    objective_3: "Prevent wolves from weaponizing the contradiction."

  - title: "Premature result on Day 0"
    derivation_method: "INFO.day==0 and analysis.yml shows result language tied to 'seer'."
    objective_1: "Clarify intent and correct if miscommunication."
    objective_2: "Minimize information leak by retracting specifics."
    objective_3: "Rebuild credibility with disciplined plans."

  - title: "Divination overlap across Seers"

    objective_1: "Use overlap to fix alignment on the target faster."
    objective_2: "Document who caused redundancy to avoid repeats."
