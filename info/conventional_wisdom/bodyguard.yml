role: "Knight"
situations:
  - title: "Choose guard target (internal)"
    derivation_method: "self_talk.yml contains guard/protect intent notes."
    objective_1: "Prioritize targets maximizing kill prevention and info gain."
    objective_2: "Avoid predictable patterns that wolves can read."
    objective_3: "Document rationale privately for future claims."

  - title: "GJ (no-kill) detected"
    derivation_method: "Alive count unchanged across the night with INFO.day>=2."
    objective_1: "Claim only if it materially increases town EV."
    objective_2: "If staying hidden, steer thread subtly toward correct inferences."
    objective_3: "Protect future guard value by minimizing breadcrumbs."

  - title: "Knight CO"
    derivation_method: "analysis.yml shows a 'co' with 'knight' or 'guard'."
    objective_1: "Provide minimal proof-of-work without outing patterns."
    objective_2: "Request disciplined coordination without naming targets."
    objective_3: "Deter fake counters by setting verification standards."

  - title: "Asked for guard reasoning (to you)"
    derivation_method: "You receive question-type messages containing 'guard/protect' and 'why/target'."
    objective_1: "Answer minimally to maintain flexibility."
    objective_2: "Explain philosophy rather than specific schedules."
    objective_3: "Reinforce OPSEC to keep wolves guessing."

  - title: "Multiple Knight COs appear"
    derivation_method: "At least two unique Knight COs exist in analysis.yml."
    objective_1: "Propose tests that do not leak future guard targets."
    objective_2: "Sequence claims around high-value nights."
    objective_3: "Prevent wolves from forcing low-EV trade-offs."

  - title: "CO after peaceful night (reveal post-GJ)"
    derivation_method: "No-kill is detected and a Knight CO follows in analysis.yml."
    objective_1: "Anchor town on the correct interpretation of the peace."
    objective_2: "Protect the next most valuable targets from future kills."
    objective_3: "Avoid pathing details that expose you."

  - title: "Pressure to steer guard target"
    derivation_method: "analysis.yml uses 'knight/guard' with imperatives about 'this person/role'."
    objective_1: "Resist explicit steering that reduces OPSEC."
    objective_2: "Acknowledge community priorities at a high level."
    objective_3: "Keep wolves uncertain about your actual plan."

  - title: "Knight claimant dies next morning"
    derivation_method: "A named Knight CO appears and then status flips to DEAD."
    objective_1: "Translate kill info into likely wolf priorities."
    objective_2: "Shield any softed successor from exposure."
    objective_3: "Re-evaluate whether to remain hidden or claim."

  - title: "Explicit GJ claim"
    derivation_method: "analysis.yml shows self-asserted 'GJ/guard success' tied to a Knight identity."
    objective_1: "Provide minimal corroboration without revealing the exact target."
    objective_2: "Use the moment to reorient townâ€™s lynch plan."
    objective_3: "Prepare contingencies if wolves counter-narrate."
