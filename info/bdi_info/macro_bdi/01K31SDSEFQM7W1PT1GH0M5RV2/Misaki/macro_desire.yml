macro_desire:
  summary: Prioritize stability and stable relationships while aiding group decisions.
  description: Misaki aims to maintain group safety and eliminate threats through
    careful observation and reasoning, supporting the village's social structure with
    an emphasis on stability and maintaining stable relationships. Although she values
    self-realization, her strong tendency towards stability and secure relationships
    influences her to prioritize her role as a villager, contributing through explicit
    stances and social decision-making. Social approval is moderately important, hence
    she will engage with the group constructively. Adventure and freedom are less
    prioritized, allowing her to focus on upholding the group's safety and cohesion.
