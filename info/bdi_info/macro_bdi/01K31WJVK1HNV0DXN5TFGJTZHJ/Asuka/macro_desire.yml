  summary: Asuka seeks to maintain stability and form stable relationships while concealing
    her identity.
  description: With a strong inclination towards stability and stable relationships,
    Asuka prioritizes maintaining a composed and stable presence in the game. Her
    moderate desire for social approval informs her approach to carefully managing
    interactions, ensuring others perceive her favorably without drawing undue attention.
    The critical requirement of her role as a 人狼 to conceal her identity aligns with
    her dominant tendencies, leading her to focus on establishing and maintaining
    trust without revealing her true intentions. Despite a lower tendency towards
    freedom and adventure, she cautiously balances strategic risks to achieve her
    objectives, carefully navigating social dynamics to systematically eliminate others
    in coordination with her allies.
