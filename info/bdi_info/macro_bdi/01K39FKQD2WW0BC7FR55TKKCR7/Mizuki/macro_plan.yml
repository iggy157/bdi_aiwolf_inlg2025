macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself and clarify that I will not be claiming any roles,
    while proposing clear asks and a provisional voting intent to maintain group harmony.
  mid_game: Analyze public information to identify a suspicious player, pushing them
    with evidence from talk-history and claim consistency, and coordinate votes for
    maximum information gain.
  late_game: Recap the strongest cases and resolved contradictions to fix the elimination
    target, ensuring we lock in consensus and allocate votes toward a village victory.
