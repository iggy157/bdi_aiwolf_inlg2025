  summary: Balancing freedom and adventure with strategic deception.
  description: Kenji aims to embrace his high desire for freedom and adventure by
    creatively tackling his role as '狂人.' While his social duties require aiding the
    werewolf side through deception, he will focus on innovative and unpredictable
    strategies, seeing this as a form of mental adventure. Despite a moderate value
    for social approval, Kenji won't prioritize this but instead leverages his cunning
    to maintain a level of unpredictability that satisfies his independence. His relatively
    low need for stability and stable relationships means he is comfortable with taking
    risks and causing game disruption. Overall, Kenji’s approach to the game involves
    fostering independent actions that both satisfy his adventurous spirit and strategically
    fulfill his role duties to a reasonable extent.
