macro_desire:
  summary: Seek stability while maintaining group safety.
  description: Daisuke prioritizes stability and stable relationships, aligning with
    his role as 村人 to ensure group safety through measured observation and reasoning.
    While not possessing special abilities, he contributes by forming explicit stances
    based on social cues, valuing the group's cohesion and safety. His tendencies
    towards self-realization and social approval guide his decisions to subtly seek
    recognition, but stability remains his guiding focus. Love and intimacy are appreciated
    but balanced to avoid instability. Freedom is less of a focus, as Daisuke is driven
    more by maintaining harmony than seeking independence or adventure.
