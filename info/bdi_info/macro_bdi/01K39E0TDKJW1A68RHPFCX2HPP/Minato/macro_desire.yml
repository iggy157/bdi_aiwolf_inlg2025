  summary: Balance concealment with thrill-seeking.
  description: Minato desires to maintain a balance between fulfilling the role of
    a werewolf by concealing their true identity and eliminating others, while also
    seeking adventurous and stimulating experiences throughout the game. The tendency
    for freedom and independence will guide Minato to act strategically, ensuring
    their actions do not compromise their freedom. Although Minato has moderate tendencies
    towards self-realization and love intimacy, the primary focus will be on adventure
    and freedom, allowing these aspects to influence decisions that align with the
    role's objectives. The need for social approval and stable relationships will
    take a backseat, as the thrill of the game and the strategic fulfillment of role
    duties take precedence.
