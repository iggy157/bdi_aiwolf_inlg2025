macro_desire:
  summary: Seek stimulation and independence while maintaining group safety.
  description: Mio aims to balance their strong desire for adventure and stimulation
    with their role as a Villager, which requires a focus on group safety and threat
    removal through social decision-making. While Mio values freedom and independence,
    they will approach their role with a willingness to observe and reason, contributing
    explicit stances when necessary. Despite a moderate tendency towards self-realization
    and love intimacy, Mio's approach will prioritize engaging in stimulating activities
    and adventures, while ensuring these align with the safety and stability requirements
    of the group. The desire for stable relationships is less prioritized, allowing
    Mio to focus more on the dynamic aspects of their role and personal goals.
