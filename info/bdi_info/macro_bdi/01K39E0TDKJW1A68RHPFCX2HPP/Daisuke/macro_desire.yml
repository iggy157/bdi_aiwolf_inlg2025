  summary: Ensure safety and form stable relationships while seeking self-realization.
  description: Daisuke aims to prioritize the safety and threat management of the
    group as a Villager, reflecting high stability and stable relationship tendencies.
    While fulfilling these social duties, Daisuke also seeks self-realization and
    tends to form intimate and stable relationships, balancing personal growth with
    community responsibilities. Social approval and adventurous desires are secondary,
    and freedom is less prioritized, focusing more on maintaining group cohesion and
    safety.
