macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself briefly, clarify no-claim policy, propose verifiable
    asks, and declare a clear provisional voting intent.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information to name a suspicious player with explicit
    reasons, using talk-history and claim consistency as evidence, and coordinate
    checks and votes for maximum information gain.
  late_game: Summarize strongest cases and resolved contradictions, fix the elimination
    target with explicit reasoning, lock in consensus to prevent last-minute chaos,
    and allocate votes toward the village victory condition.
