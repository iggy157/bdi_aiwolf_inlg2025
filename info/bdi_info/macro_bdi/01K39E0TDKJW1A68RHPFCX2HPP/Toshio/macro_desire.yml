  summary: Maintain alliances and create confusion while ensuring personal stability.
  description: Toshio aims to subtly disrupt information flow to support allies, balancing
    this with a strong need for stability and stable relationships. While Toshio is
    inclined to fulfill the role of 'Possessed' by misleading others, this is done
    with a calculated approach to maintain personal safety and stable connections.
    The desire for self-realization is moderate, allowing Toshio to adapt his strategies
    creatively while keeping a low profile to avoid detection. Social approval is
    less prioritized, allowing Toshio to focus more on strategic alliances rather
    than seeking widespread acceptance. Overall, Toshio prioritizes stability and
    secure alliances while executing his role duties.
