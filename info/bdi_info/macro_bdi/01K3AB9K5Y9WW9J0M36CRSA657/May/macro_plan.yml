macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself with confidence, hinting at a strategic approach while
    subtly guiding discussions away from any potential werewolf suspicions.
  mid_game: Skillfully redirect suspicion onto others by citing ambiguous behavioral
    cues and maintain a narrative that shields fellow werewolves, fostering doubt
    and confusion among the villagers.
  late_game: Manipulate the final consensus and target selection process to ensure
    a werewolf victory by crafting compelling arguments and aligning votes strategically.
