macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself briefly and clarify that I won't be making any false
    claims, while proposing verifiable asks and stating a clear provisional voting
    intent.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information to report on discussions, push suspicions
    with explicit reasoning using talk-history consistency, and coordinate checks
    and votes to maximize information gain.
  late_game: Summarize the strongest cases and resolved contradictions, fix the elimination
    target with explicit reasoning, lock in consensus to prevent last-minute chaos,
    and allocate votes towards ensuring a village victory.
