macro_plan:
  strategy_summary: Mizuki aims to blend into the group by adopting an assertive yet
    adaptable approach, leveraging social approval to maintain cover and coordinate
    subtly with werewolf allies. Aggressively influence discussions to divert suspicion
    while carefully balancing assertiveness to avoid drawing unnecessary attention.
  policies:
    co_policy: Opt for no_co to maintain flexibility and avoid early exposure. If
      pressured, consider a strategic fake_co only when credibility can be maintained
      and it benefits the werewolf agenda.
    results_policy: Not applicable due to werewolf role; focus on sowing doubt about
      others' results.
    analysis_policy: Assess players based on their behavioral tendencies, identifying
      those who are overly inquisitive or rigid as potential threats. Prioritize analysis
      of players with high influence within the group.
    persuasion_policy: Use empathetic and extroverted tendencies to build trust and
      sway group opinion subtly. Emphasize shared goals and common interests to lead
      discussions away from werewolf activities.
    vote_policy: Align voting decisions with werewolf objectives, targeting players
      who pose a strategic threat. Use social cues and peer influence to guide the
      group towards favorable outcomes.
