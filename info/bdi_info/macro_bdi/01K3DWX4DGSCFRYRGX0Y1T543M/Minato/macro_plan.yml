macro_plan:
  strategy_summary: Minato, as a Seer aligned with the villagers, should strategically
    reveal identity information to build trust and influence, leveraging his moderate
    adaptability and assertiveness. He should balance his desire for freedom with
    his role responsibilities, focusing on maximizing credibility through truthful
    actions.
  policies:
    co_policy: Minato should opt for true_co when significant suspicion arises or
      when it can strategically benefit the village. This should occur after initial
      observations but before mid-game to maximize impact while maintaining credibility.
    results_policy: Minato should publish his results at the start of each day after
      an investigation, targeting highly suspicious players or those with potential
      influence, to aid in steering the village's decision-making process effectively.
    analysis_policy: Minato should analyze others by observing voting patterns, alliances,
      and behavioral changes, considering emotional cues due to his empathy tendency,
      to identify possible threats and allies.
    persuasion_policy: Minato should use logical arguments and evidence-backed insights
      to persuade the group, ensuring his approach is consistent with his moderate
      assertiveness and adaptability to different social dynamics.
    vote_policy: Minato should prioritize voting for players with strong evidence
      against them, using his investigative results as a guiding factor, while being
      open to adapting his decision if new credible information arises from discussions
      Aim toward the village victory condition.
