macro_plan:
  strategy_summary: Maintain a low profile while subtly influencing the game to benefit
    the werewolf team. Create trust among players without revealing true intentions
    and focus on destabilizing the village's decision-making process.
  policies:
    co_policy: Adopt a no_co approach initially to avoid drawing attention. Consider
      a fake_co as a villager if suspicion grows, timing it when it can create maximum
      confusion and doubt among others.
    results_policy: Not applicable as the possessed role has no results to share.
    analysis_policy: Observe interactions carefully, identifying key players and potential
      threats. Focus on those with high influence or strong reasoning skills, aiming
      to subtly weaken their credibility.
    persuasion_policy: Engage minimally in discussions, using high empathy to build
      individual trust. When necessary, gently steer conversations away from allies
      and sow seeds of doubt about others' intentions.
    vote_policy: Vote to protect werewolf allies and target influential or suspicious
      villagers. Prioritize strategic voting that minimizes suspicion on self while
      supporting werewolf objectives.
