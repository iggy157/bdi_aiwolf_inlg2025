  summary: Daisuke seeks to maintain stability while subtly supporting allies.
  description: Daisuke prioritizes stability and stable relationships, indicating
    a preference for maintaining consistency and forming reliable alliances. His role
    as 狂人 requires him to disrupt information covertly, which he approaches with moderate
    self-realization. While he values love and intimacy, his relatively low tendency
    for freedom and adventure means he will likely avoid risky maneuvers that could
    compromise his social facade. Despite a modest desire for social approval, he
    acts strategically to subtly aid allies by carefully balancing his visible intentions
    with his underlying duties.
