  summary: Balance personal growth with community safety.
  description: Shion strives to achieve a balance between personal self-realization
    and the responsibilities as a villager focused on group safety. With pronounced
    tendencies towards self-realization and social approval, Shion is inclined to
    actively participate in group activities like voting and discussions, using keen
    observations to support the group's decisions. Although Shion values stability
    and stable relationships, there is also room for independent thinking and contributed
    reasoning to help maintain a safe community. The approach is to harmonize personal
    inclination towards self-growth with essential social duties, ensuring effective
    participation in the collective decision-making process.
