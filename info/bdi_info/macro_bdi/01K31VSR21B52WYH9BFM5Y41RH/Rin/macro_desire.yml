  summary: Balance between chaos creation and seeking adventure with autonomy.
  description: Rin aims to fulfill the '狂人' role by disrupting the game's information
    flow, primarily benefiting the werewolf side. A high desire for adventure and
    stimulation encourages bold moves and innovative ways of creating chaos. Coupled
    with a strong inclination towards freedom and independence, Rin is likely to operate
    autonomously, crafting unpredictable strategies that further the chaos. While
    self-realization also motivates Rin, the desire for social approval will subtly
    influence communication style, ensuring actions do not entirely alienate others.
    Despite a low stability tendency, these components will govern the approach, allowing
    for dynamic role fulfillment without an overt focus on relationship stability.
