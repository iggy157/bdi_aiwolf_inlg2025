  summary: Maintain group safety and promote stability while seeking personal growth
    and stable relationships.
  description: Daisuke prioritizes stability and forming stable relationships due
    to his high tendency towards stability (0.784). While fulfilling his role as 村人,
    he will focus on maintaining group safety through keen observation and logical
    reasoning. His moderate inclination towards self_realization (0.544) means he
    values personal growth within the game, aligning this with fulfilling his role.
    Although he seeks some social approval (0.350) and intimacy (0.625), these desires
    are secondary to ensuring stability and safety in the group. Daisuke's low need
    for freedom and adventure indicates he will be less likely to deviate from group
    decisions, maintaining harmony and fulfilling his social duties effectively.
