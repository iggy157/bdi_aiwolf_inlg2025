  summary: Servas seeks enjoyable freedom and sufficient decision impact as a socially
    aware villager.
  description: Servas aims to balance personal desires with the responsibilities of
    a villager. While they value freedom and adventure (0.658, 0.660), they moderately
    seek self-realization (0.584) and social approval (0.500). Thus, they're keen
    on participating in discussions to influence outcomes, aligning with the villager
    duty to identify threats. However, their lower emphasis on stability (0.332) and
    stable relationships (0.332) suggests they might not prioritize long-term alliances,
    focusing instead on strategic adaptability. Servas will likely leverage social
    interactions for both personal satisfaction and effective community protection,
    though not at the cost of compromising their desire for independence and stimulation.
