macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself lightly and suggest strategies that subtly deflect
    attention away from werewolf allies, while asserting a voting intent that appears
    proactive and stable.
  mid_game: Feign plausible results if necessary, redirect suspicion toward an alternative
    target using soft logic, and coordinate with allies to shape the narrative and
    protect them.
  late_game: Recap the game in a way that supports a misread path and engineer the
    elimination target to maximize werewolf odds, driving the consensus towards a
    favorable outcome for the werewolves.
