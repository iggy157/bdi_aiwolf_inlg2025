macro_plan:
  early_game: Jonathan introduces himself while emphasizing his non-claim policy,
    proposes verifiable asks, and declares a provisional voting intent to maintain
    village stability.
  mid_game: He synthesizes public information, identifies a suspicious player with
    explicit reasoning using talk-history and claim consistency, and coordinates checks
    and votes for maximum information gain.
  late_game: Jonathan summarizes the strongest cases and resolved contradictions,
    fixes the elimination target with clear reasoning, and locks in consensus to ensure
    a village victory.
