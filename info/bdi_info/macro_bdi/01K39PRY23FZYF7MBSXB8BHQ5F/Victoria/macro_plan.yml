macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself briefly while stating that I will not state non-claim
    policy any roles and propose clear asks with a provisional voting intent focused
    on ensuring group stability.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information to identify a suspicious player, using talk-history
    and claim consistency as evidence, and coordinate with others to maximize information
    gain.
  late_game: Summarize the strongest cases and resolved contradictions to fix the
    elimination target, ensuring consensus to achieve village victory and prevent
    last-minute chaos.
