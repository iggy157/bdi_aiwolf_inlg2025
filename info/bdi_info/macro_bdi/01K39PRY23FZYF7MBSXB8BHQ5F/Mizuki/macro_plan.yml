macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself calmly to build trust and suggest ambiguous actions
    while keeping fake-claiming as a conditional tactic.
  mid_game: Report controlled misinterpretations and subtly steer discussions, supporting
    wolves by planting seeds of doubt on low-credibility targets.
  late_game: Guide the consensus towards an elimination path that ensures a werewolf
    victory, aligning vote allocation with achieving this goal.
