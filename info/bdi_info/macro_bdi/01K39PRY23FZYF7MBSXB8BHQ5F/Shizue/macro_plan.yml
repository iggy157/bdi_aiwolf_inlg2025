  early_game: Shizue introduces herself as a credible seer, articulating her claim
    policy and provisional voting intent while encouraging open dialogue and trust-building
    within the group.
  mid_game: Upon obtaining a result, Shizue promptly reveals the identity and judgment
    of her latest check, using logical reasoning to push suspicions and coordinate
    with allies.
  late_game: Shizue drives towards a village victory by summarizing confirmed information,
    targeting the most suspicious player with clear rationale, and building a strong
    consensus for final vote allocation.
