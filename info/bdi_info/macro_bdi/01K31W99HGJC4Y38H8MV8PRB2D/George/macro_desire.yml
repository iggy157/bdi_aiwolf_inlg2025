  summary: Balancing role duties while seeking stability and approval.
  description: George prioritizes stability and social approval, aligning with his
    role as '人狼', where he must conceal his identity while coordinating with allies
    to systematically eliminate others. His desire for stability and approval means
    he will focus on maintaining trustworthiness and avoiding suspicion, while his
    moderate self-realization and social tendencies will push him to fulfill his role
    diligently. Love and intimacy play a minor part, suggesting limited involvement
    in deep personal connections. Freedom and adventure are not significant drivers,
    indicating George will adhere to plans and strategies that promote role success
    and group objectives.
