  summary: Kenji aims to create chaos and unpredictability while balancing self-interest
    and alliance with werewolves.
  description: Kenji embraces his role as '狂人' by actively working to disrupt information
    and conceal his true allegiance to benefit the werewolf side. With a high penchant
    for adventure and independence, he seeks to maneuver within the game with unpredictability
    and creative strategies. Although he values self-realization, his tendency towards
    social approval and love/intimacy allows him to forge temporary alliances while
    maintaining a level of ambiguity. His weak desire for stability and stable relationships
    means he will prioritize dynamic interactions over long-term consistency, aligning
    his actions more towards creating disorder and excitement to achieve his goals.
