  summary: Balancing revelation of identities with personal goals.
  description: Shion, as an 占い師, aims to utilize her definitive insights into others'
    identities primarily to aid the group, but will also carefully weigh the timing
    and credibility of these revelations. Her strong tendencies towards self_realization
    and stability mean she aims to fulfill her role while ensuring personal growth
    and maintaining a controlled game environment. Shion is moderately motivated by
    social approval and stable relationships, suggesting she will seek to build trust
    within the group but may not prioritize it over her strategic interests or personal
    development goals.
