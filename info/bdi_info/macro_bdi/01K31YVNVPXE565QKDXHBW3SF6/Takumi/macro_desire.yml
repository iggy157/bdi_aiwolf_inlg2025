  summary: Balance role disruption with need for social approval and independence.
  description: Takumi adopts a nuanced approach to their role as the 狂人, prioritizing
    the disruption of information to benefit allies, mainly the werewolf side. While
    they value social approval (0.580), which may lead them to occasionally show cooperation
    with others, their slight inclination towards freedom_independence (0.506) encourages
    independent actions to fulfill role duties. Stability (0.484) and stable_relationships
    (0.484) are secondary, suggesting that while Takumi prefers a consistent role-execution
    environment, they are willing to take calculated risks to maintain their disguise
    and support allies. Self_realization (0.448) and adventure_stimulation (0.460)
    contribute to their willingness to engage in deception, as these tendencies drive
    Takumi to explore personal capabilities and strategy within the game context.
    Overall, Takumi aims to execute their duties with a balance between achieving
    role objectives and maintaining a facade of social normality.
