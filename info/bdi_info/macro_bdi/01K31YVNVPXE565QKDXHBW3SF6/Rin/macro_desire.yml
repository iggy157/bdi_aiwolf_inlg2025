macro_desire:
  summary: Balance freedom with social duty
  description: Rin wants to navigate the game by embracing freedom and seeking stimulating
    experiences, energized by her moderate desire for self-realization. While she
    values social approval and intimacy, these are secondary to her need for independence
    and adventure. Rin approaches her role with a flexible mindset, achieving her
    duties by contributing insightful observations and reasoned stances to the group's
    decisions. Her priority will not be solely maintaining group safety, but rather
    she will strive to balance her role with her individual desires for freedom and
    new experiences. Stability and forming stable relationships are lower on her agenda,
    suggesting a dynamic participation in her role as a village member.
