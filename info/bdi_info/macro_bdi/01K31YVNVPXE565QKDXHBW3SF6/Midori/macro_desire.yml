  summary: Maintain stability and social approval by contributing to group safety
    and decision-making
  description: Midori aims to fulfill her role as a 村人 by actively participating in
    the group's safety and voting processes, balancing her desire for stability and
    social approval. Given her relatively strong tendencies towards stability (0.616)
    and stable relationships (0.616), she prioritizes harmonious interaction and group
    cohesion. With a moderate desire for social approval (0.500), she will seek the
    respect of others through thoughtful observations and decision-making support.
    Although her tendencies for self_realization, freedom_independence, and adventure_stimulation
    are lower (0.400), these desires take a backseat as she focuses on contributing
    to the group's welfare and securing stable, trusted connections within the community.
