macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself subtly to build rapport, propose questions that deflect
    attention from werewolves, and assertively declare voting intentions to appear
    engaged.
  mid_game: Deflect suspicion by suggesting alternative targets with plausible reasoning,
    using soft evidence and maintaining coordination with allies to shape the narrative.
  late_game: Recap the game in a way that supports a misread path, engineer the situation
    to target players that maximize werewolf chances, and allocate votes to secure
    a werewolf victory.
