macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself briefly, clarify my stance against making claims, propose
    verifiable asks, and declare a provisional voting intent.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information to highlight inconsistencies, name and push
    against a suspicious player using talk-history and claim consistency as evidence,
    and coordinate checks and votes for information gain.
  late_game: Summarize the strongest cases and eliminate contradictions, fix the elimination
    target with explicit reasoning, ensure consensus to prevent chaos, and allocate
    votes to secure the village's victory.
