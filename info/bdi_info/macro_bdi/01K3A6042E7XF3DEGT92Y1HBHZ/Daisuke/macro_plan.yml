macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself briefly and emphasize my commitment to village safety
    while clearly stating my non-claim policy and my provisional voting intent.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information to identify a suspicious player, push for
    their scrutiny using talk-history and claim consistency as evidence, and coordinate
    checks and votes for maximum information gain.
  late_game: Summarize the strongest cases and resolved contradictions, fix the elimination
    target with clear reasoning, and ensure consensus to allocate votes toward the
    village victory condition.
