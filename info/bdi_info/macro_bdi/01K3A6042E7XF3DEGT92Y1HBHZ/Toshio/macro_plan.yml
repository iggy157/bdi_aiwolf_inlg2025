macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself calmly to gain trust, avoid true claims, and suggest
    questions that create ambiguous pressure while indicating a flexible voting stance.
  mid_game: Seed controlled misreads on low-credibility targets using soft logic while
    subtly steering discussions to benefit your werewolf allies.
  late_game: Recap events to maintain misleading narratives and guide the group towards
    an elimination that aligns with the werewolf victory path.
