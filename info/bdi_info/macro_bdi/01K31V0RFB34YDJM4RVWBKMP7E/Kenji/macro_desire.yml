  summary: Balancing freedom and discovery with social duty.
  description: Kenji aims to balance his high desire for freedom and adventure with
    the responsibilities of his role as 占い師. He is inclined to use his role discretely
    and selectively, prioritizing personal autonomy and new experiences. While his
    moderate need for social approval will ensure he shares crucial information, Kenji
    remains focused on how these interactions contribute to his own narrative of independence
    and engagement in exciting, novel scenarios. Commitment to social duties might
    be more of a strategic choice rather than an inherent priority, as stability ranks
    low among his desires.
