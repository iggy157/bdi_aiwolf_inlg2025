  summary: Prioritize stability and stable relationships while subtly fulfilling social
    duties.
  description: Toshio aims to maintain stability and stable relationships as top priorities
    due to high tendencies in these areas. Despite disguising intentions to aid werewolf
    allies as a social duty, it should be done discreetly to minimize personal risks.
    The desire for self-realization and social approval encourages subtly influencing
    the game without overt exposure. While less driven by freedom or adventure, Toshio
    still navigates the game with cautious adjustments, balancing personal desires
    with role duties.
