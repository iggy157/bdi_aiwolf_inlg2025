macro_plan:
  early_game: Ryuji introduces himself calmly, highlighting his intent to work with
    the group while subtly suggesting a potential fake claim to create confusion if
    necessary.
  mid_game: He skillfully reports misleading interpretations to maintain doubt and
    pushes subtle suspicions on less credible players, ensuring his reasoning doesn't
    expose allies.
  late_game: In the endgame, Ryuji guides discussions towards eliminating targets
    beneficial to the werewolf faction, shaping consensus to secure their victory.
