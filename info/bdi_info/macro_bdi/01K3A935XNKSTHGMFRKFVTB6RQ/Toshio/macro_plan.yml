macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself briefly, clarify that I will not make any claims, propose
    verifiable asks, and declare a provisional voting intent to maintain village safety.
  mid_game: Combine public information to identify and push a suspicious player with
    clear reasoning, using talk-history and claim consistency as evidence, while coordinating
    checks and votes to maximize information gain.
  late_game: Summarize the strongest cases and resolved contradictions, fix the elimination
    target with explicit reasoning, lock in consensus to avoid last-minute chaos,
    and allocate votes to ensure the village's victory.
