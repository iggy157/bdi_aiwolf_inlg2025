macro_plan:
  early_game: Victoria introduces herself lightly to establish her cover and declares
    her voting intent assertively, while subtly steering discussions away from her
    werewolf allies.
  mid_game: Victoria redirects suspicion by presenting a plausible alternative target,
    citing soft logic and behavioral tells that do not implicate her allies, while
    shaping the narrative to protect them.
  late_game: Victoria frames the recap to support a misinterpretation that favors
    werewolves and engineers the elimination target to maximize their odds, ensuring
    the votes align with a werewolf victory.
