  summary: Balance independence with the seer's role.
  description: Sakura aims to maintain personal freedom and independence while fulfilling
    her role as the Seer. She values adventure and stimulation, which will guide her
    to reveal information strategically, balancing between personal desires and social
    duties. While she seeks social approval, her approach will prioritize leveraging
    her role to both satisfy her own tendencies and contribute meaningfully to the
    group's success. Stability and stable relationships are less prioritized, allowing
    for a dynamic and flexible engagement with her responsibilities.
