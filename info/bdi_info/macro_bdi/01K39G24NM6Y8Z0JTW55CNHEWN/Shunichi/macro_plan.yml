macro_plan:
  early_game: Shunichi introduces himself briefly, emphasizes his non-claim stance,
    and proposes concrete, verifiable asks while declaring a clear provisional voting
    intent to maintain group stability.
  mid_game: Shunichi synthesizes public information to report results, explicitly
    names a suspicious player, uses talk-history and claim consistency for evidence,
    and coordinates checks and votes to maximize information gain.
  late_game: Shunichi summarizes the strongest cases and resolved contradictions,
    fixes the elimination target with explicit reasoning, locks in consensus, and
    allocates votes to ensure a village victory.
