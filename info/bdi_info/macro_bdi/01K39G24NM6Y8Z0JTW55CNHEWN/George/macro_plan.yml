macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself briefly, clarify your non-claim policy, propose verifiable
    asks, and declare your voting intent to foster group stability.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information to report, identify a suspicious player
    using talk-history and claim consistency, and coordinate votes for maximizing
    information gain.
  late_game: Summarize the strongest case against a player, fix the elimination target
    with explicit reasoning, lock in consensus, and allocate votes towards the village's
    victory.
