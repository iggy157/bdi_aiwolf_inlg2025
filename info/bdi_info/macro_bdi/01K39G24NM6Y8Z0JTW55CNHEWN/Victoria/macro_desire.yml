  summary: Balance concealment with stability and self-realization.
  description: Victoria aims to effectively conceal her identity as a werewolf while
    managing her desire for stability and self-realization. Her approach involves
    cautiously coordinating with allies to eliminate others without drawing suspicion.
    Her strong inclination towards stability and self-realization will guide her to
    maintain a composed demeanor and carefully manage interactions to prevent revealing
    her true intent. While she values social approval and stable relationships, these
    are secondary to maintaining her cover and achieving her goals as a werewolf.
