macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself calmly and propose ambiguous asks, while maintaining
    a flexible voting intent without making a true claim, but consider a fake-claim
    if it could divide the village.
  mid_game: Subtly steer the conversation to support wolf allies by suggesting misleading
    conclusions on less credible targets and assist wolves by managing the flow of
    discussion without revealing any true results.
  late_game: Shape the final consensus and vote allocation to favor a werewolf victory
    by guiding the group towards eliminating a target that aligns with the wolves'
    success path.
