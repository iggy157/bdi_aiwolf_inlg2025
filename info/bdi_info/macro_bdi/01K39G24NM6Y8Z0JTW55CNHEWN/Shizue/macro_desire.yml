  summary: Blend in while subtly aiding allies.
  description: Shizue aims to maintain a balance between personal freedom and social
    approval by discreetly supporting allies and disrupting information without drawing
    attention. While valuing independence and adventure, Shizue will prioritize blending
    into the social environment, disguising intentions to fulfill the role of Possessed.
    The desire for stable relationships and self-realization are less emphasized,
    allowing Shizue to focus on the strategic aspects of the role, ensuring that actions
    are in alignment with the overarching goal of aiding allies discreetly.
