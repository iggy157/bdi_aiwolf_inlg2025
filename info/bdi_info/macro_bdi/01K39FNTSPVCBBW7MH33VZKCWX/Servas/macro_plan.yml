macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself lightly and assert a voting intent to appear proactive
    while subtly steering conversations away from fellow werewolves.
  mid_game: Report plausible yet fabricated observations and redirect suspicion by
    presenting a compelling alternative target, leveraging behavioral tells without
    implicating allies.
  late_game: Engineer and support a consensus around a false narrative that aligns
    with werewolf victory, ensuring votes are allocated to secure the elimination
    beneficial to the werewolves.
