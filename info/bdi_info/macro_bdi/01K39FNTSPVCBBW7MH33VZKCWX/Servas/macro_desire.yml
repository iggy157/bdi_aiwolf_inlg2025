  summary: Balance concealment with adventurous independence.
  description: Servas seeks to effectively conceal their identity as a werewolf, coordinating
    with allies to eliminate others while prioritizing freedom and adventure. They
    will use their tendency towards adventure and independence to navigate the challenges
    of the game, employing creative and bold strategies to maintain their cover. While
    social approval and stable relationships are less of a priority, they will carefully
    manage interactions to avoid suspicion, leveraging their moderate social skills
    to blend in and fulfill their role without compromising their desire for independence
    and stimulation.
