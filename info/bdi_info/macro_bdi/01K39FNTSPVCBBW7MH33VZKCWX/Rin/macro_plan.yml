macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself as a villager focused on balancing personal independence
    with the safety of the group, while clearly stating my non-claim policy and provisional
    voting intent.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information to identify and assertively push against
    a suspicious player using reasoning based on talk-history and claim consistency,
    while coordinating checks and votes for maximum information gain.
  late_game: Summarize the strongest cases and resolved contradictions to fix the
    elimination target, ensuring alignment with the village victory condition and
    preventing last-minute chaos by securing consensus.
