  summary: Maintain stability while subtly disrupting information.
  description: Misaki aims to maintain a stable position and secure relationships
    throughout the game, while subtly fulfilling the role of Possessed by disrupting
    information in a way that benefits allies. Her desire for stability and approval
    influences her to disguise her position carefully, balancing the need to aid allies
    with maintaining her own social standing. The approach involves indirect actions
    to create confusion, ensuring that her social reputation remains intact, while
    the primary goal of aiding allies is achieved without overt risk-taking.
