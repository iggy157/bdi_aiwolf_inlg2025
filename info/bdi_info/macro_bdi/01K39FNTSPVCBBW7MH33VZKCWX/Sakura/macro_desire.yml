  summary: Balance freedom with social duties as a Seer.
  description: Sakura prioritizes freedom and independence, seeking to maintain autonomy
    while fulfilling her role as a Seer. Her tendency towards adventure and stimulation
    drives her to explore innovative ways to manage her social duties, such as revealing
    identities strategically to enhance group dynamics. She aims to balance her moderate
    need for social approval with her duties, carefully deciding when to disclose
    information to maintain credibility. Despite her lower emphasis on stability and
    stable relationships, she understands the importance of her role in the group's
    success and strives to leverage her insights effectively while preserving her
    personal freedom and independence.
