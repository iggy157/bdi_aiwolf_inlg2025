macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself briefly and state my non-claim policy, proposing concrete
    asks that can be verified while declaring a clear provisional voting intent.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information to report results, name a suspicious player
    with explicit reasons, and coordinate checks and votes using talk-history and
    claim consistency as evidence.
  late_game: Summarize the strongest cases and resolved contradictions, fix the elimination
    target with explicit reasoning, lock in consensus to prevent last-minute chaos,
    and allocate votes toward the village victory condition.
