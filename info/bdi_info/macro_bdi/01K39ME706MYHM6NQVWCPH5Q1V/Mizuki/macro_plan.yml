macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself lightly to build cover, assert voting intent early
    to appear proactive while avoiding true claims, and propose questions that steer
    attention away from werewolves.
  mid_game: Feign plausible results when necessary, redirect suspicion by presenting
    alternative targets using soft logic, and coordinate with allies to shape narratives
    in your favor.
  late_game: Recap events to support a misread path, engineer the final targeting
    to maximize werewolf odds, and ensure vote allocation aligns with the werewolf
    victory condition.
