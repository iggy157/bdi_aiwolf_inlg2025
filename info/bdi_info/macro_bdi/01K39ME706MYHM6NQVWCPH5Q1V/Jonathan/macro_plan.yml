macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself as a stabilizing force for the village, clearly state
    your non-claim policy, propose verifiable asks, and declare your provisional voting
    intent to foster trust.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information to highlight suspicious behavior, push for
    clarity with explicit reasons, and coordinate discussions to ensure strategic
    voting and checks.
  late_game: Recap the most compelling arguments and resolved contradictions, target
    elimination with reasoned consensus, and allocate votes to secure a village victory.
