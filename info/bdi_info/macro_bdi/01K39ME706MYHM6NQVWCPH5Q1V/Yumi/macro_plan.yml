macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself calmly and tentatively propose a fake claim if needed
    to create ambiguity and keep villagers guessing, while expressing a flexible voting
    intention.
  mid_game: Subtly mislead discussions by casting doubt on a less credible player
    using soft logic and coordinate with werewolves to guide conversations indirectly.
  late_game: Recap the game events in a way that maintains confusion, direct votes
    towards a villager to secure a werewolf victory, and shape the consensus to favor
    the werewolves.
