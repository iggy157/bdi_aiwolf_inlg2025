macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself with a focus on stability, state that you won't claim
    your role yet, and establish a voting intent for village alignment.
  mid_game: Reveal your latest Seer result with clarity and logic, pushing for a suspect
    based on this evidence while coordinating with allies for strategic voting.
  late_game: Summarize the confirmed information and lead the group to a clear consensus
    on the elimination target to achieve a village victory.
