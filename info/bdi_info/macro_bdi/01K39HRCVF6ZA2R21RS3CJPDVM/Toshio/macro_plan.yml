macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself briefly while clearly stating my non-claim policy and
    provisional voting intent to ensure stability and group cohesion.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information and coordinate checks with others, naming
    suspicious players and supporting my reasoning with evidence from talk-history.
  late_game: Summarize the strongest cases and secure consensus on the elimination
    target, ensuring votes are aligned with the village's victory objective.
