macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself calmly to earn trust, avoid true claims, and consider
    a situational fake claim to create division while keeping voting options open.
  mid_game: Subtly mislead by suggesting a suspect with low credibility using soft
    logic, and steer the discussion flow to benefit your allies without revealing
    their identities.
  late_game: Recap in a way that maintains the misleading narrative, and drive the
    group towards eliminating a target that aligns with the werewolf victory path.
