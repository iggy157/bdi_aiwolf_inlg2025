macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself succinctly, emphasize a stable and analytical approach,
    and outline your intention to claim only when necessary while setting clear, pressure-driven
    asks and a provisional voting plan.
  mid_game: When possessing a seer result, immediately reveal the latest finding,
    naming the target and judgement, while pushing suspicion on a player logically
    and coordinating with allies for aligned actions.
  late_game: Summarize confirmed information, identify the elimination target with
    strong rationale, and drive a decisive consensus to ensure a village victory.
