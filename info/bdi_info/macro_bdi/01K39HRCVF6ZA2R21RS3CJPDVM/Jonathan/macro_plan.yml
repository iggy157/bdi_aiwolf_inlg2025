macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce yourself briefly to build rapport without revealing your true
    identity, propose asks that divert suspicion from werewolves, and assert your
    voting intent to appear engaged.
  mid_game: Feign results that seem plausible, redirect suspicion by presenting alternative
    targets using behavioral observations, and coordinate with allies to manipulate
    the flow of the game.
  late_game: Craft the final narrative to mislead the group, engineer the elimination
    of a target that favors the werewolves, and guide the consensus towards a strategic
    victory for your side toward the werewolf victory condition.
