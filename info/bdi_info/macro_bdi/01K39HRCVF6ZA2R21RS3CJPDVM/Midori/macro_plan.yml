macro_plan:
  early_game: Introduce myself briefly, clarify that I will not make any claims, propose
    verifiable asks, and declare my provisional voting intent.
  mid_game: Synthesize public information to name a suspicious player based on talk-history
    and claim consistency, coordinating checks and votes for maximum information gain.
  late_game: Summarize the strongest cases with resolved contradictions, fix the elimination
    target with clear reasoning, and lock in consensus to ensure a village victory.
